# Bangkit Capstone Project (Team Explorer)
We make an application that called Major.ID for our Capstone Project. The purpose of this application is helping high school student or graduated high schools student
to know more about detail information major in college. Why we interested in this theme? because of we know a lot of student in college feel depressed and suffer when they study
in the major that they don't want. Usually student in high school choosing major based on the most popular major that they've heard before that's why when they finally in that
major they realized that this major is not their passion. That's why we need to make sure that high school student know more about what will they have to take in the major they choose.

What we've done in our capstone project based on our learning path:
1. Machine Learning: Creating questions dataset using manually input & artificially generated questions from raw dataset, building chatbot models with TensorFlow using DNN architecture, using data pipeline to serve the models as api.
2. Android: Create applications that are used as media for users and also use APIs from the cloud so that they can connect bot responses that have been formed by machine learning. Here is also done deploying the application so that the application can be used by the user.
3. Cloud: Create an API to allow mobile application access into machine learning model, using docker container to run the functions and execution of ml model in cloud run.
